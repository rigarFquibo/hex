## What is a Torrent?
 
A torrent is a file that contains information about other files that are distributed over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. A P2P network is a system where users share files directly with each other, without relying on a central server. A torrent file does not contain the actual data of the files, but rather the metadata, such as the file name, size, location, and checksum.
 
To download files using a torrent, you need a torrent client, which is a software that can read the torrent file and connect you to other users who have the files you want. Some of the most popular torrent clients are uTorrent[^1^], BitTorrent[^2^], and qBittorrent[^3^]. You can download any of these clients from their official websites.
